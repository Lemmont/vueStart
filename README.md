# Vue Learning Project; VueStart
This project aims at developing a basic knowledge base for the Vue framework and its possibilities. Furthermore, getting a better understanding of backend possibilities in combination with a frontend framework such as Vue. Given that the frontend code is written in javascript, I choose to experiment with node.js as backend so that both enviroments revolve around javascript.


## Technologies
- Frontend: Vue, Vue-Router
- Backend: Nodejs, express.js, axios, postgres.js
- Database: Postgresql

## What I learned
- Basic understanding of Vue frontend capabilities
- Given my React/Next.js background, a lot of similarities were quick to be found. However, I like those of Vue more.
- Splitting the client from the server from the ground up and with my own hands (not react server components).
- Postgresql difference from normal sql. Setting up a database locally and without a library like Prisma.
